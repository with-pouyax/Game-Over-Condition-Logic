# Game Over Condition Logic
## Task Description
As I delve into coding our video game, I'm setting up crucial snippets related to the game over condition. First, I declare a variable named timeRemaining and set its value to 0. Simultaneously, I create another variable named energy and initialize it with a value of 10.

Now, I'm crafting a piece of code that will determine whether the game is over. This will be based on whether either the timeRemaining variable equals 0 or the energy variable equals 0.

## Solution 
You can check out the solution in the gameOverLogic.js file.
